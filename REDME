What the Monitoring Thread Should Handle
Since the project usually involves multithreading (or multiprocessing), a monitoring thread (or parent process) is often required to supervise the philosophers and detect potential issues. Here’s what it should handle:

Deadlock Detection

Check if all philosophers are stuck holding one fork and waiting indefinitely (circular wait).

If detected, the monitor should terminate the simulation.

Starvation Prevention

Ensure no philosopher is waiting excessively long without eating.

Optionally, enforce fairness (e.g., by tracking last meal times).

Health Check (Death Simulation)

Each philosopher has a "time to die" (e.g., if they don’t eat within time_to_die ms, they die).

The monitor should track when a philosopher hasn’t eaten in too long and terminate them.

Termination Conditions

If any philosopher dies, the monitor should stop all threads/processes.

If all philosophers have eaten enough times (must_eat count, if applicable), exit gracefully.

Logging & Synchronization

Ensure thread-safe printing (no overlapping logs).

Avoid data races when accessing shared variables (e.g., last meal time).
